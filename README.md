# MagicTrick
Program to do a simple card trick
I created this program for my C++ class.
The program will ask for your name before beginning and capitalize it properly.
Then, it asks you if you would like to see the deck before it begins and if you type y,
it will use a function to print out all 52 cards.
Next it will deal out 21 cards in 3 rows of 7 using another function.
After this it will ask you to pick a card and remember which column it was in.
It will print out columns two more times and and repeatedly ask you which column your card is in using another function.
After your third attempt it will use a final function to print out what your secret card is.
It goes through 10 cards and picks the 11th card in a function that the user does not see.
After this it will ask you if you would like to play again and if so it will start the program over for you.
